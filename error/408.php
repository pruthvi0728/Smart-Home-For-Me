Request Timeout

A 408 error occurs when the user stops the request before the
server 􀀭nished retrieving information. This error will appear when
a user closes the browser, clicks on a link too soon, or hits the stop
button. It is also common to see this error when a server is running
slow, or a 􀀭le is very large.
